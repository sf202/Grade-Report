# Grade-Report
Write a program using the switch statement name GradeReport that reads a grade from the user and prints the comments accordingly. Hint
Prompt the user to enter their grade user must be prompt to enter a numeric grade (0 to 100) if the input isn't an integer between 0 and 100, prompt the user to re-enter
Use a do loop for the re-enter of grade then if condition is not met or grade is not between 0 and 100 then prompt the user on the screen as follows
("Error: You must enter an integer between 0 and 100");”
Also incorporate a while loop to keep track of tries.
Create a variable name “tries” that will keep track of tries no more than 3 therefore if the input isn't an integer between 0 and 100, prompt the user to re-enter
